# My International News Site Recreation Project: WIP

This was a chance for me to further hone my front-end skills to recreate a popular international newspage as a static site.

## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify
This was a really great exercise to get more familiar with box model and box-sizing layouts using floats. I'd love to go back and redo this using flexbox or CSS grid as a way to get more repetition in.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be updating this project and repo in near future with adding Responsiveness with media queries, to adapt this to any screen size.

### Lessons Learned:
The project was really beneficial in terms of understanding how to keep things simple in the creation process. Taking the necessary time to get my CSS layout done first in layers, without any added images was key. This helped me focus on width percentages and knowing which elements to float in each specific containers. I had a great time recreating this news site, will perhaps make a future mock-up reflecting the BBC news platform and how it looks in 2025.
