## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify
Focused on using flexbox styling in my CSS selectors, had to be very intentful in my content choices. As opposed to other practices honing on floats. I can see why floats were traditionally used for news columns but it felt more intuitive using flexbox this time around.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be continuously updating this project and repo in near future with adding Responsiveness with media queries, to adapt this to any possible screen size without breakpoints.

### Lessons Learned:
All in all, a great exercise and practice to have in my repertoire. Enjoyed watching every component seamingly fit together at the end. This cemented the importance of knowing how to best apply flexbox, specifically in the case of adhering it to my largest containing elements. As well as the importance of encapturing every piece of content in it's own div or section to make styling easier with specificity. Also found a good use-case for flex wrap when creating the quadrant of articles on the side.
