My Social Media Recreation Project:

This was a test of my own skills, to recreate a popular social media platform landing page.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify

Fun practice utilizing mark-up languages, really experimented with using different styling choices outside of my usual rotation such as floats. This posed a slight challenge for me to be comfortable using floats to position elements.

Future Optimizations:
Will be updating this project and repo in near future with adding Responsiveness with media queries, to adapt this to any screen size.

Lessons Learned:
Learned how to better pre-visualize my layouts with floats in CSS and HTML. I know floats may seem outdated to some engineers, but I found it rewarding once everything fell into place as intended. Definitely an eye-opening creative process from start to finish.
