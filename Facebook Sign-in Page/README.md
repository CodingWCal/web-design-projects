# My Social Media Recreation Project: WIP

This was a test of my own skills, to recreate a popular social media platform landing page as a static site.

## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify

Fun practice utilizing mark-up languages, really experimented with using different styling choices outside of my usual rotation such as floats. This posed a slight challenge for me to be comfortable using floats to position elements.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be updating this project and repo in near future with adding Responsiveness with media queries, to adapt this to any screen size.

### Lessons Learned:
Learned how to better pre-visualize my layouts with floats in CSS and HTML. Ran into minor issues when making the site become responsive, especially with having used some absolute positioning in CSS. However it made me realize the importance of focusing on pre-planning my code with intent. Implementing style choices that I know can be easily tweaked as needed, to make responsive later well before the stage of adding media queries. I know floats may seem outdated to some engineers, but I used this as an exercise to test my CSS understanding capabilities by purposely using it, despite more popular conventional preferences to flexbox etc. I found it rewarding once everything finally fell into place as intended. Definitely an eye-opening creative process from start to finish.
