# My Local News Site Recreation Project: WIP

This was a personal challenge to recreate a popular local news site with various articles and ads.

## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify

Had alot of fun with adding CSS positioning to each section of this webpage, especially with its somehwat unorthodox structure. It was such a surreal experience getting to work on a site that felt close to home, it really kept me motivated about seeing this project through from start to finish.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be continuosly updating this project and repo in near future with adding Responsiveness with media queries, to adapt this to any possible screen size without breaking.

### Lessons Learned:
Felt more comfortable getting used to spacing out what specific content goes where on the screen. Things started to really click once I made a screenshot of my reference site and marked it up using a marker tool to really flush out the borders of every div and section into a proper mock-up. From there, just ran into minor issues with getting spacing to fit properly and adapting image sizes to proper aspect ratios. All in all, a really fun project! Would love to work on more Boston area content.
