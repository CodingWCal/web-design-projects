# Client Local Organization Mock-Up Project: WIP

This was an opportunity to get used to creating potential freelance work for local organizations and businesses, this was a practice creating a website for an organization centered on personal and career development.

## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML & CSS hosted on Netlify
All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience using HTML and CSS in a more practical and business-oriented setting. My prior experience with other news platform mock-ups definitely helped me feel more confident tackling this head-on.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be continuously updating this project and repo in near future with additional media queries and fixing content spacing, to adapt this to any possible screen size without break points.

### Lessons Learned:
This was by far the most fruitful exercise when trying to implement media queries onto a site. Ran into few issues with keeping content correctly spaced out in each container across each screen size. But was able to overcome these and make intentful decisions when omitting certain features whether on tablet or mobile.
