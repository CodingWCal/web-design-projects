# Rock Paper Scissors Game Project: WIP

This was fun and creative project to make a Rock Paper Scissors game where users/players can compete against a bot, while keeping score.

## How It's Made:

### Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript hosted on Netlify
It was a very fruitful excercise getting to use JavaScript and Math.random() static methods to have players play aginst a bot. The Math.random() helped give the bot a random probability of choosing either rock, paper or scissors when playing against an user. I was able to add display messages depending on the outcome of every turn for win or loss, as well as keep constant track of player and bot scores.

### Future Optimizations:
Will be continuously updating this project and repo in near future with additional media queries and fixing content spacing, to adapt this to any possible screen size without break points.

### Lessons Learned:
I thoroughly enjoyed making this game in all stages. Playing around with Math.random() and having the thrill of testing my game out felt so rewarding. Can't wait to make more games in the future, adding more complexity as I go.
